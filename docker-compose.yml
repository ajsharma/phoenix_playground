    # By default, a Postgres database is running on the 5432 port.
    # If we want to access the database from our computer (outside the container),
    # we must share the port with our computer's port.
    # The syntax is [port we want on our machine]:[port we want to retrieve
    # in the container]
    # Note: You are free to change your computer's port,
    # but take into consideration that it will change the way
    # you are connecting to your database.
